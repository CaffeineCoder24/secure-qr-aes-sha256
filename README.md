# Securing QR Code Using Visual Cryptography

## Overview
This project aims to take a qr code image as imput, apply a series of operation and then deconstruct it into two encrypted images P and R. Upon applying the decryption algorithm, the orginal qr code image is regenerated. For encryption and decryption AES and SHA-256 algorithm have been applied. This repository contains Python scripts for image processing and cryptography tasks, demonstrating practical applications of these concepts in information security.

## Image Encryption (`encryption.py`)

### 1. Encoding Image with Base64
   - The script reads an input image (`qr_code_barcode.jpg`) and encodes it using Base64 encoding.
   - The resulting Base64 encoded image data is stored in memory.

### 2. Generating Encryption Key
   - An encryption key is read from a text file (`key.txt`) and hashed using SHA-256 to generate a secure key.

### 3. AES-256 Encryption in OFB Mode
   - The AESCipher class implements AES-256 encryption in Output Feedback (OFB) mode.
   - The encoded image data is encrypted using the hashed key, and the result is Base64 encoded ciphertext.

### 4. Image Pixel Manipulation
   - A new image `C` is created based on the encrypted image data and the key.
   - Pixels are manipulated in `C` based on the key's characters, creating a unique pattern.

### 5. Saving Encrypted Images
   - The manipulated image `C` is saved as a PNG image (`P.png`) in the specified output directory.

## Image Decryption (`decryption.py`)

### 1. Loading Encrypted Images
   - The script loads the encrypted images `P.png` and `R.png` generated by the encryption process.

### 2. XOR Operation to Reconstruct Image
   - The encrypted images `P` and `R` are XORed pixel by pixel to reconstruct the original encrypted image `C`.

### 3. Decrypting Text
   - The encrypted text is read from `cipher2.txt`, which was generated during encryption.
   - AES-256 decryption in OFB mode is performed using the previously hashed key to decrypt the text.

### 4. Regenerating QR Code
   - The decrypted text is converted back to binary and used to regenerate a QR code image.
   - The QR code is saved as `regenerated_qr_code.png`.
